# COVID-BEDS

### 1. Idea of the project:

- Now a days our whole `world` is suffering from `Corona Virus`. Countries like `India, USA, Brazil, UK etc.` `Corona virus` is spreading vastly in most of their states.
- As for now considering `India` one of the major problem is states in `India` like `Uttar pradesh, Maharastra, Karnatak, Kerala, Odisha, Delhi(NCR) etc.` people are not even getting a `bed` in `hospital` for their proper treatment, for which many of them loose their lives.
- So, to solve this problem I have built this platform in which any `hospitals` can register their details properly and update their current `beds` available in a regular time format, so that any user can get the idea how many beds available in his/her nearest `hospitals` at any moment of time.

### 2. Tech Stack:

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [Typescript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript).
- For `API` I have used [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) with [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs/).
- For `Styling` I have used [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).
- Last but not the list For `Deployement` I have used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard).

### 3. Setup Project in your Local system.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
